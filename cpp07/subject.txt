Based on the provided PDF file (Subject for C++ Module 07), here is the accurate transcription of the exercises and submission guidelines.

### Chapter IV

### Exercise 00: Start with a few functions

  * **Directory:** `ex00/`
  * **Files to Submit:** `Makefile, main.cpp, whatever.{h, hpp}`
  * **Forbidden:** None

**Instructions:**

  * Implement the following function templates:
      * `swap`: Swaps the values of two given parameters. Does not return anything.
      * `min`: Compares the two values passed as parameters and returns the smallest one. If they are equal, it returns the second one.
      * `max`: Compares the two values passed as parameters and returns the greatest one. If they are equal, it returns the second one.
  * These functions can be called with any type of argument. The only requirement is that the two arguments must have the same type and must support all the comparison operators.
  * [cite_start]Templates must be defined in the header files. [cite: 123-132]

**Example Main and Output:**
Running the following code:

```cpp
int main(void) {
    int a = 2;
    int b = 3;
    ::swap( a, b );
    std::cout << "a = " << a << ", b = " << b << std::endl;
    std::cout << "min( a, b ) = " << ::min( a, b ) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "max( a, b ) = " << ::max( a, b ) << std::endl;
    std::string c = "chaine1";
    std::string d = "chaine2";
    ::swap(c, d);
    std::cout << "c = " << c << ", d = " << d << std::endl;
    std::cout << "min( c, d ) = " << ::min( c, d ) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "max( c, d ) = " << ::max( c, d ) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Should output:

```
a = 3, b = 2
min( a, b ) = 2
max( a, b ) = 3
c = chaine2, d = chaine1
min( c, d ) = chaine1
max( c, d ) = chaine2
```

### Chapter V

### Exercise 01: Iter

  * **Directory:** `ex01/`
  * **Files to Submit:** `Makefile, main.cpp, iter.{h, hpp}`
  * **Forbidden:** None

**Instructions:**

  * Implement a function template `iter` that takes 3 parameters and returns nothing.
      * The first parameter is the address of an array.
      * The second one is the length of the array, passed as a const value.
      * The third one is a function that will be called on every element of the array.
  * Submit a `main.cpp` file that contains your tests. Provide enough code to generate a test executable.
  * Your `iter` function template must work with any type of array. The third parameter can be an instantiated function template.
  * The function passed as the third parameter may take its argument by const reference or non-const reference, depending on the context.
  * [cite_start]Think carefully about how to support both const and non-const elements in your `iter` function. [cite: 189-196]

### Exercise 02: Array

  * **Directory:** `ex02/`
  * **Files to Submit:** `Makefile, main.cpp, Array.{h, hpp}` and optional file: `Array.tpp`
  * **Forbidden:** None

**Instructions:**

  * Develop a class template `Array` that contains elements of type `T` and that implements the following behavior and functions:
      * **Construction with no parameter:** Creates an empty array.
      * **Construction with an unsigned int n as a parameter:** Creates an array of `n` elements initialized by default. (Tip: Try to compile `int * a = new int();` then display `*a`.)
      * **Construction by copy and assignment operator.** In both cases, modifying either the original array or its copy after copying mustn't affect the other array.
      * You **MUST** use the operator `new[]` to allocate memory. Preventive allocation (allocating memory in advance) is forbidden. Your program must never access non-allocated memory.
      * Elements can be accessed through the subscript operator: `[]`.
      * When accessing an element with the `[]` operator, if its index is out of bounds, an `std::exception` is thrown.
      * A member function `size()` that returns the number of elements in the array. This member function takes no parameters and must not modify the current instance.
  * [cite_start]As usual, ensure everything works as expected and turn in a `main.cpp` file that contains your tests. [cite: 206-220]

### Chapter VII

### Submission and peer-evaluation

  * Turn in your assignment in your Git repository as usual. Only the work inside your repository will be evaluated during the defense. [cite_start]Don't hesitate to double check the names of your folders and files to ensure they are correct. [cite: 224-226]
  * During the evaluation, a brief modification of the project may occasionally be requested.
  * This could involve a minor behavior change, a few lines of code to write or rewrite, or an easy-to-add feature.
  * This step is meant to verify your actual understanding of a specific part of the project.
  * [cite_start]The modification can be performed in any development environment you choose (e.g., your usual setup), and it should be feasible within a few minutes unless a specific timeframe is defined as part of the evaluation. [cite: 227-233]
