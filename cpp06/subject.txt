### Chapter V

### Exercise 00: Conversion of scalar types

  * [cite_start]**Turn-in directory:** `ex00/` [cite: 280]
  * [cite_start]**Files to turn in:** `Makefile, *.cpp, *.{h, hpp}` [cite: 283]
  * **Allowed functions:** Any function to convert from a string to an int, a float, or a double. [cite_start]This will help, but won't do the whole job. [cite: 284, 285]

**Instructions:**

  * [cite_start]Write a class `ScalarConverter` that will contain only one static method "convert" that will take as a parameter a string representation of a C++ literal in its most common form and output its value in the following series of scalar types: [cite: 286]
      * [cite_start]`char` [cite: 287]
      * [cite_start]`int` [cite: 288]
      * [cite_start]`float` [cite: 289]
      * [cite_start]`double` [cite: 290]
  * [cite_start]As this class doesn't need to store anything at all, it must not be instantiable by users. [cite: 291]
  * [cite_start]Except for char parameters, only the decimal notation will be used. [cite: 292]
  * [cite_start]Examples of char literals: `'c'`, `'a'`, ... [cite: 293]
  * To make things simple, please note that non-displayable characters shouldn't be used as inputs. [cite_start]If a conversion to char is not displayable, print an informative message. [cite: 294, 295]
  * [cite_start]Examples of int literals: `0`, `-42`, `42`... [cite: 296]
  * [cite_start]Examples of float literals: `0.0f`, `-4.2f`, `4.2f`... [cite: 297]
  * [cite_start]You have to handle these pseudo-literals as well (you know, for science): `-inff`, `+inff`, and `nanf`. [cite: 298]
  * [cite_start]Examples of double literals: `0.0`, `-4.2`, `4.2`... [cite: 302]
  * [cite_start]You have to handle these pseudo-literals as well (you know, for fun): `-inf`, `+inf`, and `nan`. [cite: 303]
  * [cite_start]Write a program to test that your class works as expected. [cite: 307]
  * [cite_start]You have to first detect the type of the literal passed as a parameter, convert it from string to its actual type, then convert it explicitly to the three other data types. [cite: 308]
  * [cite_start]Lastly, display the results as shown below. [cite: 309]
  * [cite_start]If a conversion does not make any sense or overflows, display a message to inform the user that the type conversion is impossible. [cite: 310]
  * [cite_start]Include any header you need in order to handle numeric limits and special values. [cite: 311]

**Example Output:**

```
./convert 0
char: Non displayable
int: 0
float: 0.0f
double: 0.0

./convert nan
char: impossible
int: impossible
float: nanf
double: nan

./convert 42.0f
char: '*'
int: 42
float: 42.0f
double: 42.0
```

### Chapter VI

### Exercise 01: Serialization

  * [cite_start]**Turn-in directory:** `ex01/` [cite: 332]
  * [cite_start]**Files to turn in:** `Makefile, *.cpp, *.{h, hpp}` [cite: 333]
  * [cite_start]**Forbidden functions:** None [cite: 334]

**Instructions:**

  * [cite_start]Implement a class `Serializer`, which will not be initializable by the user in any way, with the following static methods: [cite: 335]
      * [cite_start]`uintptr_t serialize(Data* ptr);` [cite: 336]
          * [cite_start]It takes a pointer and converts it to the unsigned integer type `uintptr_t`. [cite: 337]
      * [cite_start]`Data* deserialize(uintptr_t raw);` [cite: 338]
          * [cite_start]It takes an unsigned integer parameter and converts it to a pointer to `Data`. [cite: 339]
  * [cite_start]Write a program to test that your class works as expected. [cite: 340]
  * [cite_start]You must create a non-empty (meaning it has data members) `Data` structure. [cite: 341]
  * [cite_start]Use `serialize()` on the address of the Data object and pass its return value to `deserialize()`. [cite: 342]
  * [cite_start]Then, ensure the return value of `deserialize()` compares equal to the original pointer. [cite: 343]
  * [cite_start]Do not forget to turn in the files of your Data structure. [cite: 344]

### Chapter VII

### Exercise 02: Identify real type

  * [cite_start]**Turn-in directory:** `ex02/` [cite: 348]
  * [cite_start]**Files to turn in:** `Makefile, *.cpp, *.{h, hpp}` [cite: 351]
  * [cite_start]**Forbidden functions:** `std::typeinfo` [cite: 352]

**Instructions:**

  * [cite_start]Implement a `Base` class that has a public virtual destructor only. [cite: 353]
  * [cite_start]Create three empty classes `A`, `B`, and `C`, that publicly inherit from `Base`. [cite: 354]
  * [cite_start]These four classes don't have to be designed in the Orthodox Canonical Form. [cite: 356]
  * [cite_start]Implement the following functions: [cite: 357]
      * [cite_start]`Base * generate(void);` [cite: 358]
          * It randomly instantiates A, B, or C and returns the instance as a Base pointer. [cite_start]Feel free to use anything you like for the random choice implementation. [cite: 359, 360]
      * [cite_start]`void identify(Base* p);` [cite: 361]
          * [cite_start]It prints the actual type of the object pointed to by p: "A", "B", or "C". [cite: 362]
      * [cite_start]`void identify(Base& p);` [cite: 363]
          * [cite_start]It prints the actual type of the object referenced by p: "A", "B", or "C". [cite: 364]
          * [cite_start]Using a pointer inside this function is forbidden. [cite: 365]
  * [cite_start]Including the `typeinfo` header is forbidden. [cite: 366]
  * [cite_start]Write a program to test that everything works as expected. [cite: 367]

### Chapter VIII

### Submission and Peer Evaluation

  * Submit your assignment to your Git repository as usual. [cite_start]Only the work inside your repository will be evaluated during the defense. [cite: 371]
  * [cite_start]Don't hesitate to double-check the names of your folders and files to ensure they are correct. [cite: 372]
  * [cite_start]During the evaluation, a brief modification of the project may occasionally be requested. [cite: 373]
  * [cite_start]This could involve a minor behavior change, a few lines of code to write or rewrite, or an easy-to-add feature. [cite: 374]
  * [cite_start]While this step may not be applicable to every project, you must be prepared for it if it is mentioned in the evaluation guidelines. [cite: 375]
  * [cite_start]This step is meant to verify your actual understanding of a specific part of the project. [cite: 376]
  * [cite_start]The modification can be performed in any development environment you choose (e.g., your usual setup), and it should be feasible within a few minutes unless a specific timeframe is defined as part of the evaluation. [cite: 377-379]
  * [cite_start]You can, for example, be asked to make a small update to a function or script, modify a display, or adjust a data structure to store new information, etc. [cite: 380]
