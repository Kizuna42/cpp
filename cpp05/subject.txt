### Chapter IV

### Exercise 00: Mommy, when I grow up, I want to be a bureaucrat\!

  * **Directory:** `ex00/`
  * **Files to Submit:** `Makefile, main.cpp, Bureaucrat.{h, hpp}, Bureaucrat.cpp`
  * **Forbidden:** None

**Instructions:**

  * Please note that exception classes do not have to be designed in Orthodox Canonical Form. However, every other class must follow it.
  * Let’s design an artificial nightmare of offices, corridors, forms, and waiting queues.
  * First, start with the smallest cog in this vast bureaucratic machine: the **Bureaucrat**.
  * A Bureaucrat must have:
      * A constant name.
      * A grade that ranges from 1 (highest possible grade) to 150 (lowest possible grade).
  * Any attempt to instantiate a Bureaucrat with an invalid grade must throw an exception: either a `Bureaucrat::GradeTooHighException` or a `Bureaucrat::GradeTooLowException`.
  * You will provide getters for both attributes: `getName()` and `getGrade()`.
  * You must also implement two member functions to increment or decrement the bureaucrat’s grade. If the grade goes out of range, both functions must throw the same exceptions as the constructor.
  * Remember, since grade 1 is the highest and 150 the lowest, incrementing a grade 3 should result in a grade 2 for the bureaucrat.
  * The thrown exceptions must be catchable using try and catch blocks.
  * You must implement an overload of the insertion (`<<`) operator to print output in the following format (without the angle brackets):
    `<name>, bureaucrat grade <grade>.`
  * [cite_start]As usual, submit some tests to prove that everything works as expected[cite: 275, 276, 279, 281, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288, 292, 293, 294, 296, 297, 306, 307].

### Chapter V

### Exercise 01: Form up, maggots\!

  * **Directory:** `ex01/`
  * **Files to Submit:** Files from the previous exercise + `Form.{h, hpp}, Form.cpp`
  * **Forbidden:** None

**Instructions:**

  * Now that you have bureaucrats, let’s give them something to do. What better activity could there be than filling out a stack of forms?
  * Let’s create a **Form** class. It has:
      * A constant name.
      * A boolean indicating whether it is signed (at construction, it is not).
      * A constant grade required to sign it.
      * A constant grade required to execute it.
  * All these attributes are **private**, not protected.
  * The grades of the Form follow the same rules as those of the Bureaucrat. Thus, the following exceptions will be thrown if a form’s grade is out of bounds: `Form::GradeTooHighException` and `Form::GradeTooLowException`.
  * As before, write getters for all attributes and overload the insertion (`<<`) operator to print all the form’s information.
  * Also, add a `beSigned()` member function to the Form that takes a Bureaucrat as a parameter. It changes the form’s status to signed if the bureaucrat’s grade is high enough (greater than or equal to the required one). Remember, grade 1 is higher than grade 2. If the grade is too low, throw a `Form::GradeTooLowException`.
  * Then, add a `signForm()` member function in the Bureaucrat class. This function must call `Form::beSigned()` to attempt to sign the form.
  * If the form is signed successfully, it will print something like:
    `<bureaucrat> signed <form>`
  * Otherwise, it will print something like:
    `<bureaucrat> couldn’t sign <form> because <reason>.`
  * [cite_start]Implement and submit some tests to ensure everything works as expected[cite: 311, 314, 315, 316, 318, 319, 320, 321, 322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 330, 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, 336, 337, 338].

### Chapter VI

### Exercise 02: No, you need form 28B, not 28C...

  * **Directory:** `ex02/`
  * **Files to Submit:** `Makefile, main.cpp, Bureaucrat.[{h, hpp}, cpp], AForm.[{h, hpp}, cpp], ShrubberyCreationForm.[{h, hpp}, cpp], RobotomyRequestForm.[{h, hpp}, cpp], PresidentialPardonForm.[{h, hpp}, cpp]`
  * **Forbidden:** None

**Instructions:**

  * Now that you have basic forms, it’s time to create a few more that actually do something.
  * In all cases, the base class Form must be an abstract class and should therefore be renamed **AForm**. Keep in mind that the form’s attributes need to remain private and that they belong to the base class.
  * Add the following concrete classes:
      * **ShrubberyCreationForm**: Required grades: sign 145, exec 137. Creates a file `<target>_shrubbery` in the working directory and writes ASCII trees inside it.
      * **RobotomyRequestForm**: Required grades: sign 72, exec 45. Makes some drilling noises, then informs that `<target>` has been robotomized successfully 50% of the time. Otherwise, it informs that the robotomy failed.
      * **PresidentialPardonForm**: Required grades: sign 25, exec 5. Informs that `<target>` has been pardoned by Zaphod Beeblebrox.
  * All of them take only one parameter in their constructor: the target of the form. For example, "home" if you want to plant shrubbery at home.
  * Now, add the `execute(Bureaucrat const & executor) const` member function to the base form and implement a function to execute the form’s action in the concrete classes.
  * You must check that the form is signed and that the grade of the bureaucrat attempting to execute the form is high enough. Otherwise, throw an appropriate exception.
  * Whether you check the requirements in every concrete class or in the base class (and then call another function to execute the form) is up to you. However, one way is more elegant than the other.
  * Lastly, add the `executeForm(AForm const & form) const` member function to the Bureaucrat class. It must attempt to execute the form. If successful, print something like:
    `<bureaucrat> executed <form>`
  * If not, print an explicit error message.
  * [cite_start]Implement and submit some tests to ensure everything works as expected[cite: 342, 343, 346, 348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358, 359, 364, 365, 366, 367, 369, 370, 371, 372].

### Chapter VII

### Exercise 03: At least this beats coffee-making

  * **Directory:** `ex03/`
  * **Files to Submit:** Files from previous exercises + `Intern.{h, hpp}, Intern.cpp`
  * **Forbidden:** None

**Instructions:**

  * Since filling out forms all day would be too cruel for our bureaucrats, interns exist to take on this tedious task.
  * In this exercise, you must implement the **Intern** class. The intern has no name, no grade, and no unique characteristics. The only thing bureaucrats care about is that they do their job.
  * However, the intern has one key ability: the `makeForm()` function. It takes two strings as parameters: the first one represents the name of a form, and the second one represents the target of the form.
  * It returns a pointer to a **AForm** object (corresponding to the form name passed as a parameter), with its target initialized to the second parameter.
  * It should print something like:
    `Intern creates <form>`
  * If the provided form name does not exist, print an explicit error message.
  * You must avoid unreadable and messy solutions, such as using an excessive `if/elseif/else` structure. This kind of approach will not be accepted during the evaluation process.
  * As usual, you must test everything to ensure it works as expected. For example, the following code creates a RobotomyRequestForm targeted at "Bender":
    ```cpp
    {
        Intern someRandomIntern;
        AForm* rrf;
        rrf = someRandomIntern.makeForm("robotomy request", "Bender");
    }
    ```

[cite_start][cite: 376, 377, 380, 381, 382, 384, 385, 386, 388, 389, 393, 395, 396].

### Chapter VIII

### Submission and Peer Evaluation

  * Submit your assignment to your Git repository as usual. Only the work inside your repository will be evaluated during the defense. Don't forget to double-check the names of your folders and files to ensure they are correct.
  * During the evaluation, a brief modification of the project may occasionally be requested. This could involve a minor behaviour change, a few lines of code to write or rewrite, or an easy-to-add feature.
  * This step is meant to verify your actual understanding of a specific part of the project.
  * [cite_start]The modification can be performed in any development environment you choose, and it should be feasible within a few minutes unless a specific time frame is defined as part of the evaluation[cite: 405, 406, 407, 408, 409, 411, 412].
