### Chapter V

### Exercise 00: Bitcoin Exchange

  * **Turn-in directory:** `ex00/`
  * **Files to turn in:** `Makefile, main.cpp, BitcoinExchange.{cpp, hpp}`
  * **Forbidden functions:** None

**Instructions:**

  * You have to create a program which outputs the value of a certain amount of bitcoin on a certain date.
  * This program must use a database in csv format which will represent bitcoin price over time. This database is provided with this subject.
  * The program will take as input a second database, storing the different prices/dates to evaluate.
  * Your program must respect these rules:
      * The program name is `btc`.
      * Your program must take a file as an argument.
      * Each line in this file must use the following format: `"date | value"`.
      * A valid date will always be in the following format: `Year-Month-Day`.
      * A valid value must be either a float or a positive integer, between 0 and 1000.
  * You must use at least one container in your code to validate this exercise.
  * [cite_start]You should handle possible errors with an appropriate error message. [cite: 1440-1452]

**Program Behavior:**

  * Your program will use the value in your input file.
  * Your program should display on the standard output the result of the value multiplied by the exchange rate according to the date indicated in your database.
  * If the date used in the input does not exist in your DB then you must use the closest date contained in your DB. [cite_start]**Be careful to use the lower date and not the upper one.** [cite: 1468-1473]

**Example Usage:**

```
$> ./btc
Error: could not open file.
$> ./btc input.txt
2011-01-03 => 3 = 0.9
2011-01-03 => 2 = 0.6
2011-01-03 => 1 = 0.3
2011-01-03 => 1.2 = 0.36
2011-01-09 => 1 = 0.32
Error: not a positive number.
Error: bad input => 2001-42-42
2012-01-11 => 1 = 7.1
Error: too large a number.
```

  * [cite_start]**Warning:** The container(s) you use to validate this exercise will no longer be usable for the rest of this module. [cite: 1475-1488]

### Chapter VI

### Exercise 01: Reverse Polish Notation

  * **Turn-in directory:** `ex01/`
  * **Files to turn in:** `Makefile, main.cpp, RPN.{cpp, hpp}`
  * **Forbidden functions:** None

**Instructions:**

  * You must create a program with these constraints:
      * The program name is `RPN`.
      * Your program must take an inverted Polish mathematical expression as an argument.
      * The numbers used in this operation and passed as arguments will always be less than 10. The calculation itself but also the result do not take into account this rule.
      * Your program must process this expression and output the correct result on the standard output.
      * If an error occurs during the execution of the program an error message should be displayed on the standard error.
      * Your program must be able to handle operations with these tokens: `"+ - / *"`.
  * You must use at least one container in your code to validate this exercise.
  * [cite_start]You don't need to handle brackets or decimal numbers. [cite: 1497-1508]

**Example Usage:**

```
$> ./RPN "8 9 * 9 - 9 - 9 - 4 - 1 +"
42
$> ./RPN "7 7 * 7 -"
42
$> ./RPN "1 2 * 2 / 2 * 2 4 - +"
0
$> ./RPN "(1 + 1)"
Error
```

  * **Warning:** The container(s) you used in the previous exercise are forbidden here. [cite_start]The container(s) you used to validate this exercise will not be usable for the rest of this module. [cite: 1510-1521]

### Chapter VII

### Exercise 02: PmergeMe

  * **Turn-in directory:** `ex02/`
  * **Files to turn in:** `Makefile, main.cpp, PmergeMe.{cpp, hpp}`
  * **Forbidden functions:** None

**Instructions:**

  * You must create a program with these constraints:
      * The name of the program is `PmergeMe`.
      * Your program must be able to use a positive integer sequence as an argument.
      * Your program must use the merge-insert sort algorithm to sort the positive integer sequence. (To clarify, yes, you need to use the Ford-Johnson algorithm.)
      * If an error occurs during program execution, an error message should be displayed on the standard error.
  * You must use at least two different containers in your code to validate this exercise.
  * Your program must be able to handle at least 3000 different integers.
  * [cite_start]It is strongly advised to implement your algorithm for each container and thus to avoid using a generic function. [cite: 1530-1542]

**Display Requirements:**

  * On the first line you must display an explicit text followed by the unsorted positive integer sequence.
  * On the second line you must display an explicit text followed by the sorted positive integer sequence.
  * On the third line, you must display an explicit message indicating the time taken by your algorithm, specifying the first container used to sort the positive integer sequence.
  * On the last line you must display an explicit text indicating the time used by your algorithm by specifying the second container used to sort the positive integer sequence.
  * [cite_start]The format for the display of the time used to carry out your sorting is free but the precision chosen must allow to clearly see the difference between the two containers used. [cite: 1543-1548]

**Example Usage:**

```
$> ./PmergeMe 3 5 9 7 4
Before: 3 5 9 7 4
After: 3 4 5 7 9
Time to process a range of 5 elements with std::[..] : 0.00031 us
Time to process a range of 5 elements with std::[..] : 0.00014 us
```

```
$> ./PmergeMe `shuf -i 1-100000 -n 3000 | tr "\n" " "`
Before: 141 79 526 321 [...]
After: 79 141 321 526 [...]
Time to process a range of 3000 elements with std::[..] : 62.14389 us
Time to process a range of 3000 elements with std::[..] : 69.27212 us
```

  * **Warning:** The container(s) you used in the previous exercises are forbidden here.
  * [cite_start]The management of errors related to duplicates is left to your discretion. [cite: 1550-1579]

### Chapter VIII

### Submission and peer-evaluation

  * Turn in your assignment in your Git repository as usual. Only the work inside your repository will be evaluated during the defense. [cite_start]Don't hesitate to double check the names of your folders and files to ensure they are correct. [cite: 1584-1586]
  * During the evaluation, a brief modification of the project may occasionally be requested.
  * This could involve a minor behavior change, a few lines of code to write or rewrite, or an easy-to-add feature.
  * This step is meant to verify your actual understanding of a specific part of the project.
  * [cite_start]The modification can be performed in any development environment you choose (e.g., your usual setup), and it should be feasible within a few minutes unless a specific timeframe is defined as part of the evaluation. [cite: 1587-1592]
